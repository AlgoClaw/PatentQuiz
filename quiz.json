At the consultation the practitioner learns that in the original patent application, Tribell had a number of claims which were subjected to a restriction requirement, but were nonelected and withdrawn from further consideration. The practitioner also determines that the claims in the patent obtained by Tribell were narrower than the broader invention disclosed in the specification, and the cited references may not preclude patentability of the broader invention.

Patent A discloses a plastic insert for the bottom of a shopping cart comprising rectangular receptacles to receive cereal boxes and to maintain them in an upright and stable position even while the shopping cart is moved about a store in order to keep them organized in the cart.

The specification goes on to state that synthetic Z is also a cure for cancer. On June 2, 2001, the practitioner received an Office action from the primary examiner rejecting the claim. The claim is rejected under 35 USC 101 as being inoperative; that is, the synthetic Z does not operate to produce a cure for cancer (i.e., incredible utility).

In the absence of a separate statement that the claims do not stand or fall together, the Board panel assigned to the case will normally select the broadest claim in a group and will consider only that claim, even though the group may contain two broad claims, such as \"ABCDE\" and \"ABCDF.\" The same would be true in a case where there are both broad method and apparatus claims on appeal in the same group. The rationale behind the rule, as amended, is to make the appeal process as efficient as possible. Thus, while the Board will consider each separately argued claim, the work of the Board can be done in a more efficient manner by selecting a single claim from a group of claims when the appellant does not meet the requirements of 37 CFR 1.192(c)(7). It should be noted that 37 CFR 1.192(c)(7) requires the appellant to perform two affirmative acts in his or her brief in order to have the separate patentability of a plurality of claims subject to the same rejection considered. The appellant must (A) state that the claims do not stand or fall together and (B) present arguments why the claims subject to the same rejection are separately patentable. Where the appellant does neither, the claims will be treated as standing or falling together. Where, however, the appellant (A) omits the statement required by 37 CFR 1.192(c)(7) yet presents arguments in the argument section of the brief, or (B) includes the statement required by 37 CFR 1.192(c)(7) to the effect that one or more claims do not stand or fall together (i.e., that they are separately patentable) yet does not offer argument in support thereof in the \"Argument\" section of the brief, the appellant should be notified of the noncompliance as per 37 CFR 1.192(d)."

The particular curvature of the bamboo both lends support to the knife to prevent it from bending and breaking and facilitates cleaning inside the fish. Jill takes a picture of Jack with the knife cleaning the fish. Subsequently, in November 1998, when Jack returns to the United States he begins to make and sell an identical knife to the one seen in Vietnam. In July 1999, he files a patent application claiming the nearly identical knife. Jack discloses no prior art during the prosecution of his application and fails to mention the knife he saw in Vietnam. The examiner finds no prior art similar to the claimed knife, and Jack is awarded a patent in December 2000. Meanwhile, Jill divorces Jack, and associates with Sam. Unfortunately, Sam is penniless. To raise cash, Sam and Jill begin selling a knife identical to the one Jack produces, only Sam and Jill make their knife out of plastic. The knives of Sam and Jill sell like hotcakes.

The Notice of Allowance specifies a sum that must be paid within three months of the mailing date to avoid abandonment. The sum specified includes both the issue fee and the publication fee. As a result of a small fire in her office building, Jill is unable to resurrect her files until the last day of the three month period. Jill mails a letter to the USPTO on February 13, 2002 using the U.S. Postal Service. Jill does not employ the procedures of 37 CFR 1.8 or 1.10 to mail the letter. The letter is received in the USPTO on February 15, 2002. The letter correctly identifies the application. The letter authorizes the USPTO to charge the proper issue fee for a small entity to her deposit account. The account has been identified in a previously filed authorization to charge fees. At the time the letter was filed in the USPTO, the account had a balance of $1000.00 in funds. Nothing in the letter authorized payment of the publication fee, no petition for an extension of time was filed, and an Office-provided issue fee transmittal form was not filed.

In her spare time, Johnnie develops an entirely novel type of coating material that she applies to floor tile. The coating material resists adhesion to chewing gum. In order to check out the effectiveness of the floor tile coating material, on December 31, 2000, she secretly covers the floor tiles in her supermarket with the new chewing gum resistant floor tile coating material. Johnnie is amazed at the results inasmuch as cleaning the floor was never easier. On January 30, 2001, Johnnie, satisfied with the experimental use results, ceased testing the use of the coating material. The ability of the coating material to withstand chewing gum adhesion continued unabated throughout the remainder of 2001. On January 1, 2002, one of Johnnie's many customers, James, remarked at how clean the floor looked. Johnnie then told James of her invention. James thinks for one moment and suggests that the floor tile coating material may be useful in microwave ovens, so that food will not stick to the interior sides of the microwave oven. James discusses getting patent protection with Johnnie. Which of the following is true?",

The rationale behind the rule, as amended, is to make the appeal process as efficient as possible.

The court notes that district courts and the Office use different standards of proof in determining invalidity, and thus, on the same evidence, could quite correctly come to different conclusions. Specifically, invalidity in a district court must be shown by \"clear and convincing\" evidence, whereas in the Office, it is sufficient to show nonpatentability by a \"preponderance of evidence.\" Since the \"clear and convincing\" standard is harder to satisfy than the \"preponderance\" standard, deference will ordinarily be accorded to the factual findings of the court where the evidence before the Office and the court is the same. If sufficient reasons are present, claims held valid by the court may be rejected in reexamination. On the other hand, a final Federal Court holding of invalidity or unenforceability (after all appeals), is binding on the Office.

If the rejection under 37 CFR 41.50(b) is not overcome, the applicant can file a second appeal (as discussed below). Such appeal must be limited to the 37 CFR 41.50(b) rejection and may not include the affirmed rejection. If the application does not become allowed or abandoned as discussed above, once prosecution of the claims which were rejected under 37 CFR 41.50(b) is terminated before the examiner, the application file must be returned to the Board so that a decision making the original affirmance final can be entered."

The court notes that district courts and the Office use different standards of proof in determining invalidity, and thus, on the same evidence, could quite correctly come to different conclusions. Specifically, invalidity in a district court must be shown by \"clear and convincing\" evidence, whereas in the Office, it is sufficient to show nonpatentability by a \"preponderance of evidence.\" Since the \"clear and convincing\" standard is harder to satisfy than the \"preponderance\" standard, deference will ordinarily be accorded to the factual findings of the court where the evidence before the Office and the court is the same. If sufficient reasons are present, claims held valid by the court may be rejected in reexamination. On the other hand, a final Federal Court holding of invalidity or unenforceability (after all appeals), is binding on the Office.

If the appellant elects to proceed before the examiner with regard to the new rejection, the Board's affirmance of the examiner's rejection will be treated as non final for purposes of seeking judicial review, and no request for reconsideration of the affirmance need be filed at that time. Prosecution before the examiner of the 37 CFR 41.50(b) rejection can incidentally result in overcoming the affirmed rejection even though the affirmed rejection is not open to further prosecution.

The examiner, however, takes official notice of the fact that element B is commonly associated with element A in the art and on that basis concludes that it would have been obvious to provide element B in the reference X widget. In reply to the Office action, the registered practitioner representing the applicant makes no amendments, but instead requests reconsideration of the rejection by demanding that examiner show proof that element B is commonly associated with element A in the art. Which of the following actions, if taken by the examiner in the next Office action would be in accord with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP? I. Vacate the rejection and allow the claim. II. Cite a reference that teaches element B is commonly associated with element A in the art and make the rejection final. III. Deny entry of applicant's request for reconsideration on the ground that it is not responsive to the rejection and allow applicant time to submit a responsive amendment.",

A plastic insert for the bottom of a shopping cart comprising circular receptacles to receive wine bottles and to maintain them in an upright and stable position even while the shopping cart is moved about a store so that they do not fall and break. Patent A discloses a plastic insert for the bottom of a shopping cart comprising rectangular receptacles to receive cereal boxes and to maintain them in an upright and stable position even while the shopping cart is moved about a store in order to keep them organized in the cart. Patent A also discloses that the receptacles could be any circular diameter to receive complementary shaped bottles or jars such as to securely hold 2-liter soft drink bottles or mayonnaise jars.

Assume the examiner has made a sufficient prima facie case of obviousness. Following receipt of the rejection, the practitioner filed a timely reply.

Buddy wanted use of his employer's machine shop to build a model. Buddy's employer was also excited about the stroller idea and its commercial potential, and the two quickly reached an oral agreement. Buddy would have free use of the machine shop equipment and supplies after regular business hours to work on his model. In exchange, Buddy agreed to assign any patent rights in his invention to the employer for $1,000.00.

One day, while seated in the stands, he caught a fly ball. He took the baseball home and played catch with his friends Andy Cannon, Orlando Torpedo, and Mariano Missle. Unfortunately for Rocket, Cannon has a problem with accuracy. Cannon threw the ball over Rocket's head and straight through a neighbor's front window. The shattered glass ripped the lining off of the baseball. Instantly, Rocket conceived a more durable baseball with an exterior similar to that of a golf ball. Rocket worked for months on his invention in Missle's garage. His new baseball was comprised of a titanium core, and a plastic shell having circular dimples and V-shaped laces. Torpedo realized and told Rocket that Y-shaped laces would enable baseball players to throw the ball faster. Cannon, an engineer in a radar gun laboratory, tested the velocity of the baseball with both V and Y-shaped laces. To Cannon's surprise, the baseball traveled 10 M.P.H. faster with the Y-shaped laces. Rocket wanted patent protection for a baseball having a titanium core, and a plastic shell having circular dimples and Y-shaped laces, so he approached Yogi Practitioner for assistance. Rocket has no obligation, contractual or otherwise, to assign his inventions to Paper America. // In accordance with proper USPTO practice and procedure, who should execute the oath?",

However, due to an unexpected emergency, he had to fly out of the country that evening to conduct discovery in another matter. Practitioner knew that he would be out of the office for at least 4 weeks, so before leaving, he left a note instructing his assistant to file the Rocket application on October 13, 2001, using an Express Mailing label. His assistant did not see the note until 8:00 P.M. on Friday, October 19, 2001. On Monday, October 22, 2001, Practitioner's assistant deposited the Rocket application in the United States Postal Service with a proper Express Mailing label. The Postal Service properly completed a legible label showing an October 22, 2001 date in. The correspondence was received in the USPTO on October 27, 2001.

He was very eager to market his invention and spent the summer meeting with potential licensees of his cellular phone patent. Throughout the summer of 2001, all of the potential licensees expressed concern that the claim coverage that Smarter obtained in his cellular phone patent was not broad enough to corner the market on this technology, and therefore indicated to him that they feel it was not lucrative enough to meet their financial aspirations. By the end of the summer, Smarter is discouraged. On September 5, 2001, Smarter consults with you to find out if there is anything he can do at this point to improve his ability to market his invention. At your consultation with Smarter, you learn the foregoing, and that in his original patent application, Smarter had a number of claims that were subjected to a restriction requirement, but were nonelected and withdrawn from further consideration. You also learn that Smarter has no currently pending application, that the specification discloses Smart's invention more broadly than he ever claimed, and that the claims, in fact, are narrower than the supporting disclosure in the specification.

Following a three-way restriction, Mr. Flash prosecuted the claims for the candle, and was granted a patent (\"P1\"), which issued on April 6, 1999. Mr. Flash filed a divisional application containing claims for the method of making the candles and for the reflective housing on April 5, 1999. The examiner did not restrict the claims, but before the first action on the merits was mailed, Mr. Flash suffered business reversals and canceled the claims to the reflective housing to reduce the cost of obtaining his patent. A patent on the method of making the candles (\"P2\"), issued on November 30, 1999. Although you reviewed and signed all of the papers in the prosecution of the applications, your assistant, Annie, did all the work under your supervision. On April 1, 2001, Mr. Flash jumps into your office. He has just won a million dollars on some television game show you've never heard of, and he wants to \"revive his patents.\" He is also concerned about an article he tore out of the February 1986 issue of the trade publication Wicks and Sticks, that shows a drawing of a dissimilar candle that would nevertheless raise a question of patentability, with the caption \"It's just a dream: it can't be made we've tried a thousand times, don't bother.\" He also has a video tape first sold by a local hobbyist at his store in October 1999, showing a process of candle making that may be within the scope of his process claims. \"But it's such a stupid way to do things - it's expensive and it doesn't work very well- it doesn't even make a safety candle,\" Jack shouts, jumping on your desk. He is so excited he can barely get the words out. Annie volunteers to work with him to figure out what he can do. On the next day, Friday, April 2, just as you are getting ready to close up and head for the LeTort Creek with your cane rod Annie drops five proposals on your desk.

Brick receives a first Office action dated June 4, 2001 from the primary examiner handling Brick's application. The examiner rejected Brick's claim only under 35 U.S.C. 103 on the grounds that Reference X teaches a bouncing ball called \"Q,\" and that although \"Y\" and \"Q\" are not the same, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill to make changes to the \"Q\" ball in order to obtain a ball just like Brick's \"Y\" ball.

Brick includes a declaration, signed by Mrs. Kane, that includes extensive data comparing the bouncing results for the \"Y\" and \"Q\" balls and showing that the \"Y\" ball bounces unexpectedly higher than the \"Q\" ball.

                "question": "James Salt developed an environmentally friendly technique for controlling deer overpopulation. Briefly, Salt discovered a non-hormonal substance XYZ (\"Antiagra\") that efficiently suppresses sexual function in male deer with minimal side effects. Salt determined that the use of a non-hormonal substance eliminated adverse long-term health effects that may be experienced with hormonal substances. He then dissolved an effective amount of Antiagra in salt water, poured the resulting solution into a plurality of twenty-gallon tubs, and heated the tubs to evaporate the water. The resulting blocks of salt, throughout which Antiagra was evenly disbursed, were distributed in overpopulated areas during deer mating season to serve as salt licks. Stags that used the salt lick show no interest in mating, thereby lowering the pregnancy rate among does and helping to control the deer population. Salt has retained you to conduct a prior art search and, if appropriate, prepare and file a patent application. The only relevant prior art located during the prior art search is a patent to Deere that discloses a salt lick on which a hormonal substance is sprayed. A doe that uses the salt lick ingests the hormonal substance which, in turn, suppresses ovulation and thereby reduces the pregnancy rate. You prepare and file a patent application that provides a fully enabling disclosure and includes four claims sets. Claims 1-5 are directed specifically to the non-hormonal substance (Antiagra), claims 6-9 are directed to a salt lick laced with a non-hormonal substance that, when ingested by a male deer, suppresses sexual function in the male deer, claims 9-14 are directed to the method of forming the salt lick, and claims 14-20 are directed to a method for controlling deer population by distributing salt licks that are treated with an effective amount of XYZ to reduce pregnancy rates. You also properly establish small entity status on behalf of Salt at the time the application is filed. // Upon initial examination, the patent examiner issues a requirement for restriction on the basis that the application claims two or more independent and distinct inventions. Specifically, the examiner requires an election between (a) claims directed to the nonhormonal substance per se (claims 1-5); (b) claims directed to the salt lick and to the method of forming the salt lick (claims 6-14); and (3) claims directed to the method of controlling deer population by distributing salt licks that are treated with XYZ to reduce pregnancy rates (claims 15-20). The restriction requirement was set forth in an Office action dated December 12, 2001, and the examiner set a one month (not less than 30 days) shortened statutory period for response.

                "question": "James Salt developed an environmentally friendly technique for controlling deer overpopulation. Briefly, Salt discovered a non-hormonal substance XYZ (\"Antiagra\") that efficiently suppresses sexual function in male deer with minimal side effects. Salt determined that the use of a non-hormonal substance eliminated adverse long-term health effects that may be experienced with hormonal substances. He then dissolved an effective amount of Antiagra in salt water, poured the resulting solution into a plurality of twenty-gallon tubs, and heated the tubs to evaporate the water. The resulting blocks of salt, throughout which Antiagra was evenly disbursed, were distributed in overpopulated areas during deer mating season to serve as salt licks. Stags that used the salt lick show no interest in mating, thereby lowering the pregnancy rate among does and helping to control the deer population. Salt has retained you to conduct a prior art search and, if appropriate, prepare and file a patent application. The only relevant prior art located during the prior art search is a patent to Deere that discloses a salt lick on which a hormonal substance is sprayed. A doe that uses the salt lick ingests the hormonal substance which, in turn, suppresses ovulation and thereby reduces the pregnancy rate. You prepare and file a patent application that provides a fully enabling disclosure and includes four claims sets. Claims 1-5 are directed specifically to the non-hormonal substance (Antiagra), claims 6-9 are directed to a salt lick laced with a non-hormonal substance that, when ingested by a male deer, suppresses sexual function in the male deer, claims 9-14 are directed to the method of forming the salt lick, and claims 14-20 are directed to a method for controlling deer population by distributing salt licks that are treated with an effective amount of XYZ to reduce pregnancy rates. You also properly establish small entity status on behalf of Salt at the time the application is filed. // Claim 6 of the application reads: \"A composition for reducing the pregnancy rate among wild deer population, said composition comprising salt and a non-hormonal substance that, when ingested by a male deer, is operable to suppress sexual function in the male deer.\" Claim 7 reads: \"The composition of claim 6, wherein said non-hormonal substance is XYZ.\" Claim 8 reads, \"The composition of claim 6, wherein said composition is formed in a block and wherein said non-hormonal substance is interspersed substantially evenly throughout said block.\" Each of these claims is fully supported by the specification. An Office action is mailed March 15, 2002. Claim 6 was rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over the Deere patent. Which of the following arguments, if presented in a timely reply to the March 15 Office action, is most likely to persuade the examiner to remove the 103 rejection without presenting unpersuasive arguments?",

In contrast, the Deere patent utilizes a substance that is sprayed on the outer surface of the salt lick and, therefore, is effective only so long as the outer portion of the salt lick is available.",

In her spare time, Johnnie develops an entirely novel type of coating material that she applies to floor tile. The coating material resists adhesion to chewing gum. In order to check out the effectiveness of the floor tile coating material, on December 31, 2000, she secretly covers the floor tiles in her supermarket with the new chewing gum resistant floor tile coating material. Johnnie is amazed at the results inasmuch as cleaning the floor was never easier. On January 30, 2001, Johnnie, satisfied with the experimental use results, ceased testing the use of the coating material. The ability of the coating material to withstand chewing gum adhesion continued unabated throughout the remainder of 2001. On January 1, 2002, one of Johnnie's many customers, James, remarked at how clean the floor looked. Johnnie then told James of her invention. James thinks for one moment and suggests that the floor tile coating material may be useful in microwave ovens, so that food will not stick to the interior sides of the microwave oven.

                "question": "Xavier residing in Canada, a NAFTA country, files an application for a Canadian patent Monday, September 18, 2000. At the same time, Xavier forwards a copy of the Canadian application to registered practitioner Young in the United States, asking that Young prepare a U.S. application based on the Canadian application and claim the benefit of the Canadian filing. Young advises Xavier on the relative merits of filing a provisional versus a non-provisional application and Xavier decides to have Young initially file a provisional U.S. application. Young prepares the application and files it as a provisional application on Friday, January 19, 2001, claiming the benefit of the Canadian application. In August 2001, Young reminds Xavier that the filing was only provisional and that Xavier must decide whether to file a non-provisional application. In early January 2002, Xavier directs Young to get a non-provisional application, with a certified copy of the English language Canadian application, into the Office, which Young does on Friday January 11, 2002. Young files no other correspondence prior to the first Office action. Which of the following is true?",

On November 9, 2001, they asked you to file a U.S. patent application for their invention. PTI is located in the United States, has an attendance of over 5,000 students, and (1) admits, as regular students, only persons having a certificate of graduation from a school providing secondary education, or the recognized equivalent of such a certificate, (2) is legally authorized within the jurisdiction in which it operates to provide a program of education beyond secondary education, (3) provides an educational program for which it awards a bachelor's degree or provides less than a 2-year program which is acceptable for full credit toward such a degree, (4) is a public institution, and (5) is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency. You also find out that Poly Tech's research which led to the invention of the new system was funded by Atlantic Telcom Corporation (ATC) (a for profit corporation with over 500 employees and that does not meet the small business standard defined in 13 CFR 121) and a license agreement has been signed which would give ATC the right to participate in the prosecution of the patent application and also the right to make and use the invention, upon the payment of royalties, if the application ultimately issues as a patent.
